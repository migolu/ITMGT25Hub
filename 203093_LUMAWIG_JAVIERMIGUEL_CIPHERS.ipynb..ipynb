    "\n",
    "A _cipher_ is a way of disguising a message by encoding it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ciphers is a \"shift cipher\" known as the _Caesar cipher_. The way it works is very simple.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a message, such as \"ATTACK AT DAWN\".\n",
    "2. Choose a number, such as 3.\n",
    "3. _Shift_ all letters in the message to the right by the chosen number. In this case, shifting all letters in \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" by 3 results in the message \"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a function called `problem_1` that takes two positional arguments `message` and `shift`. It should apply the Caesar cipher to a message and _return_ the result.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example input/output:  \n",
    "`problem_1(\"ATTACK AT DAWN\", 3)` => `\"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\"`  \n",
    "`problem_1(\"MEAMORE\", 42)` => `\"CUQCEHU\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "For full credit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function must ignore spaces.\n",
    "2. The function must be able to \"wrap around\" if it reaches the end of the alphabet. (e.g., shifting Z by 1 should result in A, shifting Z by 2 should result in B, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience:\n",
    "1. Assume that all letters will be uppercase.\n",
    "2. Be aware of the `chr()` function. `chr()` takes an Unicode code number and returns the character associated with that number (e.g., chr(65) => \"A\").\n",
    "3. Be aware of the `ord()` function. `ord()` takes a Unicode character and returns the Unicode code associated with that character (e.g., ord(\"A\") => 65).\n",
    "4. Be aware that the Unicode codes of the uppercase English alphabet are Unicode codes 65 to 90, where 65 = A, 66 = B, ..., 90 = Z.\n",
    "5. The shift will always be a positive integer."

    "## Scytale Cipher (8 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another ancient cipher (of questionable effectiveness) is the scytale-based cipher. A _scytale_ is a cylinder around which you can wrap a long strip of parchment that contained a string of apparent gibberish. The parchment, when read using the scytale, would reveal a message due to every nth letter now appearing next to each other, revealing a proper message.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Here is the algorithm you can use to implement a scytale-style cipher:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Encoding__\n",
    "1. Take a message to be encoded and a \"shift\" number. For this example, we will use \"INFORMATION_AGE\" as the message and 3 as the shift.\n",
    "2. Check if the length of the message is a multiple of the shift. If it is not, add additional underscores to the end of the message until it is. In this example, \"INFORMATION_AGE\" is already a multiple of 3, so we will leave it alone.\n",
    "3. This is the tricky part. Construct the encoded message. For each index `i` in the encoded message, use the character at the index `(i // shift) + (len(message) // shift) * (i % shift)` of the raw message. If this number doesn't make sense, you can play around with the cipher at https://dencode.com/en/cipher/scytale to try to understand it.\n",
    "4. Return the encoded message. In this case, the output should be \"IMNNA_FTAOIGROE\".\n",

    "__Write a function called `problem_2` that takes two positional arguments `message` and `shift`. It should apply this scytale-style cipher to a message and return the encoded message.__  \n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience:  \n",
    "1. A message will only ever contain capital letters and underscores. (Underscores will be used to represent spaces.)  \n",
    "2. The shift will always be a positive integer, and it will never exceed the length of the message."
